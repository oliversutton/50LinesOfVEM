# 50 Lines Of VEM
An implementation of the virtual element method in 50 lines of Matlab, to compute approximate solutions to Poisson's problem (-âˆ†u = f) using the lowest order virtual element method on polygonal meshes. This package provides the main 50-line code, alongside some example meshes and certain extra support functions which are useful for defining the problem data and visualising the solution.

For an in-depth discussion of the code and algorithms, please see the associated paper:

[1] Sutton (2017), [*The virtual element method in 50 lines of MATLAB*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11075-016-0235-3 "The virtual element method in 50 lines of MATLAB"), Numerical Algorithms, 75, pp.1141-1159

This code was reviewed alongside the article and is also available via NETLIB as the package `na45` in the [numeralgo](http://www.netlib.org/numeralgo/) library.

## Usage
The `source` directory contains the Matlab sources for the package. Add this to your Matlab path using
```MATLAB
addpath('/PATH/TO/PACKAGE/sources');
```
Running the method simply involves calling the `vem` function with the
following three arguments:
1. the path to a mesh file, e.g. `source/meshes/voronoi.mat`
2. a function handle to a function implementing the PDE right hand side, e.g. `@square_domain_rhs`
3. a function handle to a function implementing the PDE boundary condition, e.g. `@square_domain_boundary_condition`

So, for example, Figure 3(a) in the paper [1] can be produced by calling:

```MATLAB
u = vem('source/meshes/voronoi.mat',@square_domain_rhs, @square_domain_boundary_condition);
view(150,30)
```
Similarly, Figure 3(b) can be produced by running:

```MATLAB
u = vem('source/meshes/L-domain.mat', @L_domain_rhs, @L_domain_boundary_condition);
view(120,30)
```

These compute the solution to a Poisson problem on a square domain and an
L-shaped domain, respectively.

The `meshes` subdirectory contains files specifying various polygonal meshes:

- `L-domain.mat` : a Voronoi polygonal mesh of an L-shaped domain
- `non-convex.mat`: a mesh of a square-shaped domain consisting of non-convex polygonal elements
- `smoothed-voronoi.mat` : a mesh of a square-shaped domain, formed of a Voronoi mesh which has been smoothed using Lloyd's algorithm as implemented by [Polymesher](https://paulino.ce.gatech.edu/journal_papers/2012/SMO_12_PolyMesher.pdf)
- `squares.mat`: a mesh of a square-shaped domain consisting of square elements
- `triangles.mat`: a mesh of a square-shaped domain consisting of triangular elements
- `voronoi.mat`: a Voronoi mesh of a square-shaped domain, formed using random centroids

An explanation of the data structures used to describe the meshes in these
files is provided in the paper [1], along with illustrations of each mesh (shown in Figure 1). Other compatible meshes can be generated using the [Polymesher](https://paulino.ce.gatech.edu/journal_papers/2012/SMO_12_PolyMesher.pdf) tool, for example.
